 * Priority (onboarded-first):

 *   hasOnboarded + workspace[0] → /<first.slug>/me
 *   hasOnboarded + no workspace → /workspaces/new
 *
 * V3 invariant: `onboarded_at != null` is the single source of truth for
 * "may access /<slug>/*". The web workspace layout and the desktop App.tsx
 * overlay decision both gate on this — sending an un-onboarded user
 * straight to /issues would just be redirected back to /onboarding by
 * the layout gate, costing a navigation round-trip. Check onboarded
 * first.
 *
 * The onboarding loading screen reuses an existing workspace, including
 * one left by an interrupted first run, before completing onboarding.
 *
 * Callers that need invitation-aware routing (callback / login) handle
 * the "un-onboarded with pending invites" branch themselves before calling
 * this resolver — this resolver only deals with the post-invite-check
 * destination.
